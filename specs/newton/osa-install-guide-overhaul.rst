Blueprint: Overhaul of the current OpenStack-Ansible Installation Guide
  * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+spec/install-guide
  * https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+spec/osa-install-guide-overhaul

After the 2016 Austin summit, there was a discussion and a consensus
surrounding the current state of the OpenStack-Ansible Installation Guide.

.. note::

    A `blueprint and spec <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/241037/1>`_ were previously created
    with the intention of improving the documentation that pushed the summit discussion.

Currently, the OpenStack-Ansible install guide has minimal installation
information, and a lot of configuration information. This specification proposes
a more formalized plan to separate this information and streamline the
installation guide to make it easier and quicker to install OpenStack.

Problem description
===================

The OpenStack-Ansible Installation Guide contains information that does not
necessarily pertain to that of an installation guide structure. It has
accumulated a lot of configuration information and reference information that
reduces the user's focus and simplicity to install OpenStack.

The current installation guide also does not follow the openstack-manuals
documentation conventions.

Proposed change
===============

The main focus of the installation guide is reorganising and developing
content so a deployer makes very few decisions and minimal configuration
to deploy an OpenStack test environment and production environment.

The proposed changes are:

* Clearly define reference architecture and develop use case configuration
  examples in an appendix.

* Removal of the configuration information from the current installation guide
  and including it in the OpenStack-Ansible role documentation.

* Migrate operations content temporarily to openstack-ansible-ops repo
  until an operations guide can be produced.

* Restructure the guide to include basic deployment configuration.

* Appendices that include configuration file examples, neutron plugins,
  cinder options and additional resources relevant to an OpenStack-Ansible
  installation.

* Include links to role based documentation from the Installation Guide.

Alternatives
------------

* Leaving the installation guide as is, and migrating only the configuration
  information to the developer docs.

* Consider revising the installation guide to meet criteria in
  `project-specific installation guide
  <http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/docs-specs/specs/newton/project-specific-installguides.html>`_
  and publish to docs.openstack.org

These changes will hopefully improve the end user experience, by providing
a more structured and better flow of information to install OpenStack.

Move existing content over to the roles first, then developers must

Work items
----------

- Clarify and obtain consensus on the content structure
- Gather information from SMEs as needed
- Create a draft directory for installation guide changes
- Create a work items list and allocate resources
- Ensure documentation meets openstack-manuals writing conventions
- Test draft documentation before publication

Testing
=======

The testing will be conducted by the community once a draft is available.
OpenStack-Ansible users will be asked to follow the new installation guide
to install OpenStack and evaluate if the information provided is accurate,
clear, and concise.

Documentation impact
====================

This is a documentation change, N/A.
